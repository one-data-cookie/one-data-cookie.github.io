* Trying to teach the habit of digging deeper
* Bullshit = when you create non-sense bc you don't care
* Calling bullshit = even on lies, injustice
* Clean the information bullshit around us, similarly to physical environment
* We all create bullshit = we babble to look credible > be bullshit-neutral
* Methaphor: It often happens when you interpret or create viz, since you think you understand
* They critise smth similar to Tufte's chartjunk
* You don't need to undestand the black box, algorithm, to call bullshit -- just understand what is getting in (source) and out (isn't it a bit too surprised)
* Publication bias -- you only publish interesting and expected results -- false positives. Desk-drawer effect.
* How to call bullshit? Make it ad absurdum. Attack the argument, not people. Make a dialogue. Give people benefit of the doubt.
* Self-bullshit is the worst!
