## Problem
[Headless BI](https://basecase.vc/blog/headless-bi)
- Imagine instead that you could disentangle metric definition from visualization. In this world, the teams that own metrics would be able to define them once, in a way thatâ€™s consistent across dashboards, automation tools, sales reporting, and so on.
