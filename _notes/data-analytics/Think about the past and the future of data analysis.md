* **Everyone is a data analyst, whether they know it or not and whether they like it or not.**
* Training for data analysis is essential, but there is limited bandwith.
* We can automate or teach. None of them is perfect.
* Tukey JW, The Future of Data Analysis: If data analysis is to be well done, much of it must be a matter of judgement and theory, whether statistical or non-statistical, will have to guide and not command.
* Theory comes to rescue. It provides a scalable understanding of what's good and what's not. Like in music.
* Today, there is still a lot of discussion about the "instruments" rather than the "music" that is being produced.
* We have a good idea a posteriori but not a priori.
* Basically, you need to be provided with everything – both software and data – to be able to reproduce the results. You also need to be quite knowledgable in the field to understand what's going on.
* **Examples of aesthetics we could apply to data analysis:**
	* *Reproducible*: analytic code, software packages, VCS, data formatting, metadata, documentation, distribution
	* *Translatable*: modularised analysis pipelines, quantitative programming environment, generalisable principles, reusable code practices, APIs
	* *Robust to New Data*: statistical techniques, assertive testing, input validity, modular design, code review, fail loudly and early
	* *Simple to Communicate*: statistical technique, medium, peer review
* What makes a good data analysis? What makes a good data analyst?
* It's basically figured out for data visualisation though. And that thanks to science and testing what works and what doesn't.
