If there is a way to describe data analysis workflow in a diagram, this would be it:

This fits within a broader **PPDAC cycle**:
1. **Problem**: Identify the issue or question you want to address. Define the objectives of your study.
2. **Plan**: Decide on how to approach the problem, what data is needed, how to collect it, and what techniques to use for the analysis.
3. **Data**: Collect the data according to your plan. This may involve conducting surveys, experiments, observations, or pulling from existing databases.
4. **Analysis**: Analyze the collected data. This often involves statistical techniques to summarise data, identify patterns, make comparisons, and draw inferences.
5. **Conclusion**: Interpret your analysis in the context of the original problem. Make conclusions or predictions based on your results, and consider if your findings answer your initial question.
