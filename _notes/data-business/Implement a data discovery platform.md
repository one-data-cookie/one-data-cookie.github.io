**Questions we ask in the data discovery process**
- Where can I find data about...?
- What is the data about?
- Who can I ask for access?
- How is the data created? Can I trust it?
- How should I use the data?
- How frequently does the data refresh?

**Features to find, understand, and use data**

	- Help users find data via recommendations
- * Understanding*:

	- Provide column usage statistic
	- Providing a list of most commonly joined tables
	- Provide recent queries
	- Provide data lineage (downstream)
