- Next time you get asked to justify the ROI for your team, don't. Sit back, and let others tell the story for you.
- If your partners aren’t willing to go to bat for you like this, then it’s time to take a step back to rethink how you’re operating.
	- *Organisation*: let the team (esp. analysts and scientists) be close to the business, not in a silo
	- *Planning*: be it tied to other teams' goals
	- *Tools*: make your outputs accessible to others
