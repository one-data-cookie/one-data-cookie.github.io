## Problem
- data-driven = we make our decisions using data
	- -> it doesn’t recognize the hard work of data scientists/analysts as the focus is on the data, not the analyses
- data-driven *vs* analytics-driven:
	- analysts fetch data *vs* analysts find answers.
	- hire more and more analysts/DS as “hands” *vs* invest in infrastructure, tooling, and education.
	- “Can you pull these numbers…?” *vs* “Can you help me think about…?”
	- Finds data that justifies management decisions *vs* generate insights that tell a compelling story management can act on
- As a data scientist or analyst, you are the person most familiar with data, so naturally data-related requests will come to you. My default response has always been to drop a query/dashboard on stakeholders ASAP, which I’d promptly forget about. But then I’d have to repeat the work the next time I was asked. **Plus, this sort of ad-hoc response just reinforces the perception that your relationship with decision-makers is purely transactional.**

## Solution
- Stakeholders need to get in the habit of asking business-level questions of analytics, not having data requests.
- Make your job masterful and reproducible, ask the big questions (if not requested by the leadership)
- Document everything (analyses, transformations, tables)
- "Doing high-quality well-documented work"
