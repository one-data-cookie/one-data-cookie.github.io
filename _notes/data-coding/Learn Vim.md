## Philosophy
1. Optimise for reading code/text, not writing
2. Be programmable by itself (keystrokes are composable commands)
3. Avoid the mouse (too slow) or even the arrow keys (too much hand movement)

In practice this means using different "modes of operation" for different kinds of tasks.

## Vim modes
- **NORMAL** (`<ESC>`, sometimes double)
    - Default mode the editor starts in; one should spend most of the time here
    - Each keypress is equivalent to an editor command
-   **INSERT** (`i`)
    - "Normal" mode of other editors
    - Each keypress actually inserts a character to a given file
-   **VISUAL** (`v`)
    - Allows you to take a selection of text and apply various transformations
-   **COMMAND** (`*`)
    - Lets you run commands that control the whole editor in its "command line"
    - Technically known as _Command-line_ or _Cmdline_ mode
- You use the `<ESC>` key a lot when using Vim: consider remapping Caps Lock to Escape ([macOS instructions](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Map_caps_lock_to_escape_in_macOS)).

- File: `gg` (beginning of file), `G` (end of file)
- Line numbers: `:{number}<CR>` or `{number}G` (line {number})
- `fx`: jump to the next occurrence of character `x`
- `/{regexp}<Enter>`: look up `{regex}` from the current line downwards (with `n` for next)
- `u`: undo
- `y`: copy/yank
