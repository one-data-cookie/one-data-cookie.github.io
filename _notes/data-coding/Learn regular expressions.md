## Intro
- Regular Expressions = "regex" or "regexp"
- Comes from the `ed` editor but you'll mostly encounter the `grep` program
- A quick way of describing a particular pattern of characters in text
- Allows for extremely effective search and replace
- Comes from the `ed` editor from UNIX but you'll mostly encounter the `grep` program

> Knowing [regular expressions] can mean the difference between solving a problem in 3 steps and solving it in 3,000 steps. When you’re a nerd, you forget that the problems you solve with a couple keystrokes can take other people days of tedious, error-prone work to slog through.
