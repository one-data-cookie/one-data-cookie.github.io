## Motivation
-   I’m learning to solve interesting problems associated with larger and more complex codebases
-   I’m building relationships with interesting people across the world
-   Satisfaction from building tools that improve others’ working lives
-   Unique elements to my career story
-   Recognition in the data community has proved extremely beneficial for professional networking and seeking advice.

## Lessons Learned
1.  You don’t need to understand all the code
1.  Contributing to a new codebase just _is_ hard, but a good workflow will make life easier
1.  Contribute when you have a reason to.

## Advantage over Software
Simply put, **open source is a superior approach at building and distributing software** because it provides important guaranties around how software can be discovered, tried, operated, collaborated on and packaged.

If I could only use a single word to describe why the time is right for organizations to adopt open source BI, the word would be **freedom**.  Flowing from the principle of freedom comes a few more concrete superpowers for an organization:
* the power to customize, extend and integrate
* the power of the community
* avoid vendor lock-in
