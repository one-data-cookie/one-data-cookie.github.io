- I first encountered this function when trying to join two tables together using about eight separate fields. Not ideal.
- The natural inclination is to create your own ID by simply concatenating a bunch of fields together. These columns are bad because they _kind of_ look like data but operate as an ID. Itâ€™s important to have a column whose sole function is to be a unique identifier for that row.
- Instead, use [MD5 functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_MD5.html) to create unique IDs on AWS. IDs that are obviously IDs reduce confusion among junior analyst and end users by removing semi-comprehensible data strings throughout your database.
- At any rate, be aware that MD5 is [no longer considered strong](https://valerieaurora.org/hash.html) as a hash function, should it contain sensitive information
- More info on how this works is in [[Learn about cryptography]]

```sql
select md5('Amazon Redshift')
