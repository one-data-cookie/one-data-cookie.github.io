# Test
* They think that if they live with it, they understand it.
* Data fluency
* Easiest thing is to put it on the test
* Great mismatch between high school teachers (all maths) and college (core skills, rest we can teach): arithmetics (fractions), data analysis and critical thinking (ratios, ...), heart of algebra (linear equation).
* New SAT: more data in verbal parts, more data in maths.
* Freakonomics Survey: Calculus: 2% use daily, Geometry: 4% daily, 70% Excel, 75% dataviz.
* 65% saying they'd wish to know how to analyze data to get hidden insights, 60% dataviz and make an argument with data.
* Data instead Algebra II
* UCLA & LA School District: Intro to Data Science
* They put data science into diff exams and diff subjects, instead of elective course
* Course that is designed to teach teachers and students at the same time
* Freakonomics/math
