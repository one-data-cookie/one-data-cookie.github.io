Five years ago, Jack Welch famously stated that there are three fundamental ways to motivate employees: financial rewards, recognition, and a clear mission.

A fourth motivational principle must be added: personal growth and development.

Ideas:
* You can also encourage team leads and managers to be more deliberate about highlighting successful outcomes from using data.
* Train managers to focus on providing private recognition to exceptional employees.
* Create a "Data Expert of the Week" award
* Ask people to consume relevant content about how data can be used in their roles, and use your internal chat app to share interesting and relevant articles that employees find throughout the week.
