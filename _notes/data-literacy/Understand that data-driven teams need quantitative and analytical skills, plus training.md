1. **Foster critical thinking**
This means questioning your own biases, distrusting your intuition, and displaying a healthy degree of skepticism when presented with ideas and suggestions from others

2. **Invest in training**
So, the primary investment is not money, but time.

3. **Hire the right people**
In other words, most of the training-related gains in expertise or knowledge can be predicted by people's initial potential, which makes good hiring more consequential than great training. 

This depends on their level of general intelligence or cognitive ability, which is the single best predictor of a person's ability to solve well-defined reasoning problems and acquire formal knowledge in any area of competence.
