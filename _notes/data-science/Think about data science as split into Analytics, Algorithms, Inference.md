The main takeaway I will share is that companies consider three tracks of data science work to meet the needs of your business -- Analytics, Inference, and Algorithms.

*The Analytics* track is ideal for those who are skilled at asking a great question, exploring cuts of the data in a revealing way, automating analysis through dashboards and visualizations, and driving changes in the business as a result of recommendations.

*The Algorithms* track would be the home for those with expertise in machine learning, passionate about creating business value by infusing data in our product and processes.

And *the Inference* track would be perfect for our statisticians, economists, and social scientists using statistics to improve our decision making and measure the impact of our work.

## Technical

**Analytics** - Defines and monitors metrics, creates data narratives, and builds tools to drive decisions

**Foundation** - Demonstrates ownership and accountability for data quality and code (expected for all tracks)

## Business (expected for all tracks)

**Ownership** - Able to drive projects to success, enables others, owns impact

**Influence** - Communicates clearly, demonstrates teamwork, and builds relationships

**Enrichment** - Contributes to team-building through mentorship, culture, recruiting, and diversity efforts

We encourage team members to be generalists as well (sometimes that's a point of confusion).

We didn't start to specialize until around 2015 when our team was 30 people.

Analytics experts understood they would have less impact if they tried to apply machine learning to the business problems they were working on.
