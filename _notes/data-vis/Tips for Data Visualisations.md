General Tips

-   Albert Einstein: “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.”
-   It depends whether operational overview or having a strong message
-   "It depends" idea -- consider purpose, audience, chart, LoD
-   Using Tableau for data mining and storytelling
-   Design it the way it is natural for the user > "they are a king"
-   Don't make it too cluttered > enough space around vizes > "data-ink ratio"
-   Only data should be seen
-   Always make sure the data are correct before sending them out
-   Use colour for the context > strap it and build back
-   making numbers human through scaling and comparisons
-   visuals should be rewarding = you should learn something
-   visuals should be simple to understand and pleasing
-   Headline should be a story, subheadline could a description
-   Uncover users' needs: Situation Problem Implication Need > tell me what I don't know

Notes

-   Tableau has its own engine -- stands alone for quick data exploration, but Power BI and Qlick use D3, so they are limited to reporting for which it was meant > you cannot find things that you don't know
-   Cord Chart
