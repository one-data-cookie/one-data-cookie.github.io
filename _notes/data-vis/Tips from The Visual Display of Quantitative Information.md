**Main Idea of the Book**

**Part I: Graphical Practice**

**1 Graphical Excellence**

Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data – a matter of _substance_, of _statistics_, and of _design_.
Graphical excellence consists of complex idea communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency.
Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest place.

Graphical excellence is almost always multivariate.
Graphical excellence requires telling the truth about data.

-   Time-Series: _"Time-series displays are at their best for big data sets with real variability. Why waste the power of data graphics on simple linear changes."_
-   Time-Series, genious:

-   Time-Series: _"The problem with time-series is that the simple passage of time is not a good explanatory variable: descriptive chronology is not causal explanation.":_

-   Narrative Graphics of Space and Time: _"An especially effective device for enhancing the explanatory power of time-series displays is to add spatial dimensions to the design of the graphic, so that the data are moving over space (in two or three dimensions) as well as over time.":_

-   Narrative Graphics of Space and Time: _"Small multiples are economical: once viewers understand the design of one slice, they have immediate access to the data in all other slices."_
-   Relational Graphics: _"The relational graphics – in its barest form, the scatterplot and its variants – is the greatest of all graphical designs."_

2 Graphical Integrity
Graphical integrity is more likely to result if these six principles are followed:

1.  The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented.
2.  Clear, detailed, and thorough labelling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out explanations of the data on the graphic itself. Label important events in the data.
3.  Show data variation, not design variation.
4.  In time-series displays of money, deflated and standardised units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units.
5.  The number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data.
6.  Graphics must not quote data out of context.

-   James Thurber, Further Fables for Our Time (New York, 1956): _"Get it right or let it alone._ _The conclusion you jump to may be your own."_
-   Distortion in Data Graphic:

    -   _"A_ _graphic does not distort if the visual representation of the data is_ _consistent with the numerical representation."_
    -   _"__The special power of graphics_ _comes in the display of large data sets."_
    -   _"The representation of numbers, as physically_ _measured on the surface of the graphic itself,_ _should be directly proportional to the numerical_ _quantities represented."_

    -   _"Clear, detailed, and thorough labelling should be_ _used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity._ _Write out explanations of the data on the_ _graphic itself. Label important events in the data."_
    -   _"It is wrong to distort the data measures – the_ _locating values of numbers – in order to make an editorial_ _comment or fit a decorative scheme"_
-   Design and Data Variation:
    -   _"__Show data variation, not design variation."_
    -   _"__In time-series displays of money, deflated and_ _standardised units of monetary measurement are_ _nearly always better than nominal units."_
-   Visual Area and Numerical Measure:
    -   _"__Many published efforts using areas to show magnitudes make_ _the elementary mistake of varying both dimensions simultaneously_ _in response to changes in one-dimensional data. (...)_ _The number of information-carrying (variable)_ _dimensions depicted should not exceed the_ _number of dimensions in the data."_
-   Context is Essential for Graphical Integrity:
    -   _"__Graphics must not quote data out of context."_
-   Conclusion:
    -   _"__It is the special character_ _of numbers that they have a magnitude as well as an order;_ _numbers measure quantity. Graphics can display the quantitative_ _size of changes as well as their direction._

**3 Sources of Graphical Integrity and Sophistication**
The conditions under which many data graphics are produced – the lack of substantive and quantitative skills of the illustrators, dislike of quantitative evidence, and contempt for the intelligence of the audience – guarantee graphic mediocrity. These conditions engender graphics that (1) lie; (2) employ only the simplest designs, often unstandardised time-series based on a small handful of data points; and (3) miss the real news actually in the data.

Graphical competence demands three quite different skills: the substantive, statistical, and artistic. Let's reject once and for all the doctrines that data graphics are for the unintelligent and that statistics are boring. These doctrines blame the victims (the audience and the data) rather than the perpetrators.

-   _"__And so, just as there is a double standard of integrity at a good_ _many news publications-one for words, another for graphics, so_ _there is a double standard of sophistication. The statistical_ _graphics are stupid; the prose is often serious and sometimes even_ _demanding of expertise."_
