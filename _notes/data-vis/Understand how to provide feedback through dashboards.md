- “What you measure, you improve.” _But how does this actually work?_
- To understand effective, motivational data design, you need to understand the **psychology of feedback**.
- Effective dashboards provide effective feedback and rely on two dynamics:
	1. They increase our commitment to a goal; by:
		-  Highlighting past progress (e.g., Atom, fundraising progress bars)
		-  Making the feedback experience itself rewarding or fascinating (e.g., Atom, Robinhood)
		-  Downplaying failures (e.g., weight graphs)
		-  Shrinking the perceived distance to a larger goal (e.g., fundraising thermometers)
	1. They draw contrast between our current state and goal state; with:
		-  Two numbers (e.g., speed limit signs)
		-  Long distance goals (e.g., weight graphs, fundraising progress bars)
		-  Social comparisons
		-  Various benchmarks (e.g., Tufte and Powsner, Worklytics)
- *Example*: The left speaks to viewers’ commitment. The right highlights the contrast between users’ current and target states.
