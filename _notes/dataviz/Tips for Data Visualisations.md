General Tips

*   Albert Einstein: “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.”
*   It depends whether operational overview or having a strong message
*   "It depends" idea -- consider purpose, audience, chart, LoD
*   Using Tableau for data mining and storytelling
*   Design it the way it is natural for the user > "they are a king"
*   Don't make it too cluttered > enough space around vizes > "data-ink ratio"
*   Only data should be seen
*   Always make sure the data are correct before sending them out
*   Use colour for the context > strap it and build back
*   making numbers human through scaling and comparisons
*   visuals should be rewarding = you should learn something
*   visuals should be simple to understand and pleasing
*   Headline should be a story, subheadline could a description
*   Uncover users' needs: Situation Problem Implication Need > tell me what I don't know

Notes

*   Tableau has its own engine -- stands alone for quick data exploration, but Power BI and Qlick use D3, so they are limited to reporting for which it was meant > you cannot find things that you don't know
*   Cord Chart
