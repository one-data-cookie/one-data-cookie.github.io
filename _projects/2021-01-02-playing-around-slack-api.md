Excited by Slack's API, I put together two scripts: [a Python emoji stats snippet](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/slack-emoji-stats) and [a Javascript ticketing system](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/slack-ticketing-system). I also wrote two blog posts ([here](https://medium.com/slido-dev-blog/primal-data-advent-calendar-3-how-to-discover-the-most-used-emojis-in-your-slack-channel-46bca5b5912d) & [here](https://medium.com/slido-dev-blog/primal-data-advent-calendar-7-building-a-slack-app-for-ticketing-system-80a432580936)) detailing them for an Advent article series. They've collectively got around 8k views and 4k reads â€“ a very pleasant surprise!
