I was invited by [Milad Abassi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miladabassi) to help out [JIC](https://www.jic.cz/en/), the Innovation Centre for South Moravian Region, with standardising their geo data from multiple sources. As a part of the process, I created [`geocode-mapycz`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/geocode-mapycz) that wraps JavaScript geocoding API of [Mapy.cz](https://en.mapy.cz/) in Python.
