[Tomáš Marek](https://www.marektomas.cz/), [Jáchym Kubáček](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1chym-kub%C3%A1%C4%8Dek/), and myself put together a course on data literacy at the [Faculty of Arts of Masaryk University](https://www.phil.muni.cz/en). The initial audience consisted mostly of librarians, however, we also created an [online course](https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/kisk4future/datova-gramotnost) designed for and available to anyone.
