When playing around with some tools of the [modern data stack](https://blog.getdbt.com/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/), I ended up building a minimalistic and free version of it called Modern Data Stack for All at [`one-data-cookie/mds4all-elt`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/mds4all-elt) and [`one-data-cookie/mds4all-superset`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/mds4all-superset) whilst utilising [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), [Meltano](https://meltano.com/), [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), and [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).
