At the beginning of 2022, I got very excited by [changes to the way IT gets taught in the Czech Republic](https://revize.edu.cz/). As a result, I spent one week at a [primary school in Písek](https://www.zstylova.cz/eng/) teaching 12 and 15-year-old kids about IT using the priciples of [computational thinking](https://www.imysleni.cz/about-the-project). All thanks to an amazing educational project called [Začni učit!](https://zacniucit.cz/).
