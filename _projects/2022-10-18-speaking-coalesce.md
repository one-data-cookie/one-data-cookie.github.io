Twice was I honoured to speak at [Coalesce](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/), the [analytics engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) conference. In 2022, I joined my colleagues to [talk about Data API](https://youtu.be/SIZ4b0HJbUo) we built at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/), as well as [Elizabeth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adlha) from [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) to [share some thoughts](https://youtu.be/VdiYC8LU4a0) on bringing a product mindset to data analytics. In 2021, we [shared our Slido analytics story](https://youtu.be/YA0yqYSs9BQ) and I demoed [`dbt-superset-lineage`](https://github.com/slidoapp/dbt-superset-lineage), a Python-coded open-source CLI app that connects [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) and [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/).
