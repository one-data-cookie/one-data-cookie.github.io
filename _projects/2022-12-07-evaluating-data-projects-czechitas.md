I was invited by [Czechitas](https://www.czechitas.cz/en) to sit on a jury with [Milada](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milada-sejnohova) and [Pavel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-klammert-9500046b) to evaluate [data projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bag3ntZsNyq9fi0AK2qWAF-6qQiTyrRr3dIO4FrkWJ8/edit?usp=sharing) of emerging data analysts who just finished the [Data Academy](https://www.czechitas.cz/kurzy/digitalni-akademie-data) in Brno. And it was amazing to see it was (almost) all about using open data or making an analysis for a good cause!
