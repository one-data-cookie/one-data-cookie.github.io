I collaborated with [Michal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dubravcik) from [Kontent.ai](https://kontent.ai/) to organise the first [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) meetup in Brno., held at [Kentico](https://www.kentico.com/) HQ. We strived for introducing this beloved data tool of ours to local audience through [these talks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XZS-x6uIiNbAKBOUHOGq-c8pg7Q-uYYh2FbHIMqeSus/edit?usp=sharing) from Michal himself, [Ivo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-steiner) from [Slido](https://www.slido.com/), and [Pavel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jezekpavel) from [STRV](https://www.strv.com/). As I also had the pleasure to host the event, I've found it to be great fun! And – based on the feedback (4.9/5) – I might not have been alone.
