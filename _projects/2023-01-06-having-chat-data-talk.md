I had a chance to appear as a guest on a podcast episode of [Data Talk](https://datatalk.buzzsprout.com/). I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was thrilled about the idea. And it didn't disappoint! I ended up having an [inspiring conversation](https://datatalk.buzzsprout.com/2034779/12010833-data-talk-21-michal-kolacek-slido) with two other data enthusiasts – [Jiří Vicherek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vicherek/) and [Karel Šimánek](linkedin.com/in/karelsimanek/) – about the people, technology, and overarching philosophy behind our data story at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/).
