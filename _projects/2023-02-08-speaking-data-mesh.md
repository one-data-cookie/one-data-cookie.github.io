As a follow-up on my podcast episode of [Data Talk](https://datatalk.buzzsprout.com/), [Jiří Vicherek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vicherek/) and [Karel Šimánek](linkedin.com/in/karelsimanek/) asked me to speak at their first-ever [Data Mesh meetup](https://www.datamesh.cz/) in Brno. I had a blast sharing my insights on the [power of using a product management mindset](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x99TqWWr4KA3AeW06Yg67yCek14_PtmZKsEi5c03bKY/edit?usp=sharing) to drive data product success at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/).
