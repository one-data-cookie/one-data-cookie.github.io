I was invited by [Petr Bouchal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petrbouchal) from [České priority](https://www.ceskepriority.cz/) to lead a workshop on [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), a visualisation tool we've been long using at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/). With representatives from [Technology Agency of the Czech Republic](https://www.tacr.cz/en/), [Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic](https://www.mpo.cz/en/), and [CzechInvest](https://www.czechinvest.org/en), it was a lively discussion that delved into the similarities and differences in our use cases between the private and public sectors.
