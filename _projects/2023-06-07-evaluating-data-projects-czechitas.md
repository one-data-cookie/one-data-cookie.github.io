I was invited by [Czechitas](https://www.czechitas.cz/en) to sit on a jury (with [Barbora](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbora-nem%C4%8Dekov%C3%A1-a1a6a01a2) and [Adam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/este-adam) in 2023, and with [Milada](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milada-sejnohova) and [Pavel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-klammert-9500046b) in 2022) to evaluate data projects of emerging data analysts who just finished the [Data Academy](https://www.czechitas.cz/kurzy/digitalni-akademie-data) in Brno. And it was amazing to see it was (almost) all about using open data or making an analysis for a good cause!
