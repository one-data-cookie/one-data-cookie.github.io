Under the banner of [JIC](https://www.jic.cz/en/), the Innovation Centre for South Moravian Region, I crafted a [brief data-viz narrative](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-6QRUlGUtmOWvlxYgKrzp-LMesll8DrkTCFm3xrhR-E/edit?usp=sharing) to enrich the context of a project aimed at advocating for technical education. This analysis dove into statistics related to both secondary school and university students, particularly focusing on technical disciplines. I was later given the opportunity to present this analysis at a meeting attended by representatives from both the private sector and the South Moravia Region.
