Following in the footsteps of Prague and Brno, Bratislava has now hosted its very own dbt meetup, too. I was thrilled to get invited to speak at the event and chose to share my insights on [promoting data culture through dbt](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-m8EzPf3dzbv67PCOyr0Qh7OLB23JhFqKh6J-_I-n1g/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g25445e1ca20_5_540). In good company, I was joined by [Radek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomsej) from [LMC](https://www.lmc.eu/en/) and [Tomáš](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-janotik/) from [Infinite Lambda](https://infinitelambda.com/). It was a real treat, exchanging ideas and pooling our shared knowledge!
