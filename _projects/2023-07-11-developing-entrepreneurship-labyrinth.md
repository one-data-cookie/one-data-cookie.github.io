Alongside [Břetislav Svozil](https://cz.linkedin.com/in/b%C5%99etislav-svozil-5a4069b5) and [Vojtěch Krmíček](https://cz.linkedin.com/in/krmicek), we crafted a strategy for fostering entrepreneurship at [ZŠ Labyrinth](https://labyrinthschool.cz/), a laboratory primary school in Brno. Our approach is threefold: incorporating entrepreneurship lessons into the curriculum, establishing JuniorHub as a space for projects to take shape, and hosting inspirational community events. All these elements aim to empower children to realise their ideas for transforming the world around them. Good luck to all the young minds embarking on this journey!
