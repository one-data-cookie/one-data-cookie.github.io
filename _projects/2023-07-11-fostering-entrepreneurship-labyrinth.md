Alongside [Břetislav Svozil](https://cz.linkedin.com/in/b%C5%99etislav-svozil-5a4069b5) and [Vojtěch Krmíček](https://cz.linkedin.com/in/krmicek), we crafted a strategy for bringing entrepreneurship at [ZŠ Labyrinth](https://labyrinthschool.cz/) in Brno. Our approach is threefold: entrepreneurship lessons in the curriculum, a collaborative space called JuniorHub, and inspirational community events. All aim to empower children to realise their ideas for transforming the world around them. Good luck to all the young minds embarking on this journey!
