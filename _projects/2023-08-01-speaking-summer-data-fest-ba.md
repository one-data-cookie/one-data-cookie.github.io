As a part of the data meetup series organised by [Slido](https://www.slido.com/) and [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/), we decided to throw in a summer edition â€“ Summer Data Fest. I opened with a rather philosophical [talk on data nihilism](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12DEvbVZdXLuT7ACzJiVXfXnBtu_EG5i11p1Q5wfbwZY/edit#slide=id.g25db8a68bd3_0_260), [Jozef](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jozefreginac) from [STRV](https://www.strv.com/) shared about the "Funny Side of Data" and [Martina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martina-ivanicova) from [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/) led a panel discussion about ChatGPT's impact on the data ecosystem. What a lovely evening spent with 100+ enthusiasts from the local data community!
