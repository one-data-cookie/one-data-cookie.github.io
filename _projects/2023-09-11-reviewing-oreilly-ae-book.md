In collaboration with [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/), a renowned publisher of tech books, I had the privilege of giving a technical review on [Analytics Engineering with SQL and dbt](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/analytics-engineering-with/9781098142377/). The focus was on building meaningful data models at scale, a topic vital to the industry. It was an enriching experience to delve into the intricacies of analytics engineering and contribute to a resource aimed at the broader community.
