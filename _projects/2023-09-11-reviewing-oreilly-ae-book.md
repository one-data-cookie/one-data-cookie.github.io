In collaboration with [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/), a renowned publisher of tech books, I had the privilege of giving a technical review on [Analytics Engineering with SQL and dbt](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/analytics-engineering-with/9781098142377/). The focus was on building meaningful data models at scale, a topic that resonates deeply with the current needs of the industry. It was an enriching experience to delve into the intricacies of analytics engineering and provide valuable feedback to the authors, contributing to a resource that aims to impact the whole community.
