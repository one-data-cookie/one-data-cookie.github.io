After launching the first-ever dbt meetup in Czechia and Slovakia last autumn, [Jozef](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jozefreginac/) from [STRV](https://www.strv.com/) returned this year with a fresh twist – a breakfast gathering. He invited me to co-host, and we were joined by 
[Arthur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurtwmills/) from [EssenceMediacom](https://www.essencemediacom.com/), [Veronika](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronikapeskova/) from [GAMEE](https://www.gamee.com/), and [Matěj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/novakmates/) & [Robert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rvojacek/) from [Revolt BI](https://www.revolt.bi/). Our speakers [discussed their recent data challenges](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shnmPlMAMjh0pjbwYM-P98ZhoxkU_dUT0TOonvEKBzk/edit?usp=sharing) and sat on a panel on "Data Team's ROI". Who says breakfast is just about the food?
