I've once again had the privilege of delivering a [data storytelling lesson](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rPCV9llCpI8QHmQgHiQEzEaHSc9nfjJu71oJS_1MWoM/edit?usp=sharing) for [Czechitas](https://www.czechitas.cz/en)' [Data Academy](https://www.czechitas.cz/kurzy/digitalni-akademie-data) in Brno, just as I did in May 2023 (both [online in Prague](https://youtu.be/9G56P-Hoxds) and [in a hybrid format in Brno](https://youtu.be/HFTbGvy7W1g)), as well as in [Nov 2022](https://youtu.be/m0n4mWlg6bE), [May 2022](https://youtu.be/XbPFNBdAdW0), and [Nov 2021](https://youtu.be/YoCbP-f_fEc). It's always a delightful experience!
