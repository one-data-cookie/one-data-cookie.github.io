To explore [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s GPTs, I put together a GPT called [TeachEUR](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-LVHsur4qW-teacheur) and also [open-sourced](https://gist.github.com/one-data-cookie/cf3ad5b633f838f519455327af16468d) its setup. It is designed to assist myself and other educators in creating lesson plans using the ["Evokace-Uvědomění-Reflexe" (E-U-R)](https://wiki.rvp.cz/Knihovna/1.Pedagogick%c3%bd_lexikon/E/E-U-R) teaching method, i.e. "Evoke-Understand-Reflect" in English.
