During the autumn semester of 2023, [Tomáš Marek](https://www.marektomas.cz/) and I led a data-focused course at the [Faculty of Arts at Masaryk University](https://www.phil.muni.cz/en), aimed at adult lifelong learners. [Our curriculum](https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/kisked/pasivni-kurzy/kisked03) spanned philosophical foundations, practical skills, and visualisations tactics. Combining discussion-style webinars with e-learning lessons, we fostered an interactive and self-directed learning environment.
