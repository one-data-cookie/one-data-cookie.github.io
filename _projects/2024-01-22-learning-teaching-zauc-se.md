More than a year after discovering [Za훾ni u훾it!](https://zacniucit.cz/), I decided to engage further with their educators community by joining their subsequent offering specifically designed for novice teachers. The programme [Zau훾 se!](https://zacniucit.cz/chci-se-zaucit/) spanned an entire semester of autumn and included 9 sessions totalling 38 hours of learning alongside a small, cohesive group of 11 like-minded individuals. What an intensive and inspiring ride it was!
