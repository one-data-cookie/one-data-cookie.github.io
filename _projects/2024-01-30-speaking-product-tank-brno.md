Following an invitation from [Pavel Šafařík](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavelsafarik/), I had the opportunity to present to a non-data audience for the first time – at a meetup for the [local product community](https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Brno/), attracting nearly 100 attendees. I shared the stage with fellow speaker [Anita Friess](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anita-frie%C3%9F-669591177/) and the experience was thoroughly enjoyable. Though my talk ["Data Team? Product Team!"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ubwNCVI8HYOGM8tPT_MZ9RIXGXLAXC4jyUl0i8ZdJpA/edit?usp=sharing) felt like a bit of a gamble, it appeared that the audience had fun just as much.
