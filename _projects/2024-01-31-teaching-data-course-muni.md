[Tomáš Marek](https://www.marektomas.cz/) and I partnered to deliver a semester-long course on working with data, hosted by the [Faculty of Arts at Masaryk University](https://www.phil.muni.cz/en), designed for adults pursuing lifelong learning. [Our curriculum](https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/kisked/pasivni-kurzy/kisked03) covered a wide range of topics – from exploring philosophical underpinnings, through providing practical hands-on experience, concluding with how visualisations can be used to influence or even mislead. We combined e-learning lessons with discussion-style webinars, promoting an interactive and self-paced learning environment.
