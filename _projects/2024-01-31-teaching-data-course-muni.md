During the autumn semester in 2023, [Tomáš Marek](https://www.marektomas.cz/) and I led a data-focused course at the [Faculty of Arts at Masaryk University](https://www.phil.muni.cz/en), targeting adult lifelong learners. [Our curriculum](https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/kisked/pasivni-kurzy/kisked03) covered philosophical foundations, practical skills, and visualisations tactics. We combined e-learning lessons and discussion-style webinars, promoting an interactive and self-directed learning environment.
