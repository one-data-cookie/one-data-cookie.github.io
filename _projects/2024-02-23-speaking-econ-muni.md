I recently dropped by the [Faculty of Economics at Masaryk University](https://www.econ.muni.cz/en) with a session titled ["From Excel to Data Product (and Beyond!)"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13XNHoZE3eQVs_qsosh9Ywcg-13vx0GnzNjckXm7sjno/edit?usp=sharing), following an unexpected invite from my master's thesis supervisor, [Marketa Matulov√°](https://www.muni.cz/en/people/8987). Aimed at students of [Business Data Analytics](https://www.econ.muni.cz/pro-uchazece/bakalarske-studium/26416-analytika-byznysovych-dat), the talk sparked great feedback. It was a unique chance to revisit my alma mater and dive into discussions that bridged academic concepts with real-world applications. A hidden gem of an experience, sharing insights with the upcoming data enthusiasts!
