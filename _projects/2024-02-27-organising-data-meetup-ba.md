[Slido](https://www.slido.com/) and [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/) initiated a series of data meetups in Bratislava, aimed at fostering inspiration and best practices amongst local data practitioners. I had the honour of hosting a few editions â€“ [#1 on analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16lasZVOzDS87bCialZzpAa2Q9JS2zEbx8mEaH5euN9c/edit?usp=sharing), [#3 on data engineering](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_JB77N1Hu8Nvn0icHh7lxmPAMUKUyiPT2kU5nfqiI28/edit?usp=sharing), and [#6 on Python in cloud](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/154NrW8sw5Mz9kHTwmbLIivccSUwCr8SyVniET4UYi24/edit?usp=sharing). You can even check out the [recording from the first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiY3TYQfLNU) to gauge the event's quality for yourself.
