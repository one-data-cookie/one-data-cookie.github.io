[Slido](https://www.slido.com/) teamed up with [STRV](https://www.strv.com/) and [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/) to organise two data meetups in Czechia over two days â€“ one in Prague and one in Brno. The topic was "Flavours of Data Stack", where each team showcased technical solutions to their company's business problems. I was joined on stage by [Mimi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miriama-k%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%BEkov%C3%A1-998731114/), [Jozef](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jozefreginac/), [Peter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-vanko-99548159/), and [Stanislav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanislav-repka-a14ab31b2/), with [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y9psjpWNh8GB-Z7w8Kw7fjarvBfkFreNctxaAj3_xlE/edit?usp=sharing) having been presented to the audience.
