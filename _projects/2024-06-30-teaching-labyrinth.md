With the school year 2023/24 well underway, I stepped in to teach IT for a few weeks to students aged 12–16 at [Labyrinth](https://labyrinthschool.cz/en/), a private primary & secondary school in Brno. Thanks to [Břetislav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/b%C5%99etislav-svozil-5a4069b5)'s invitation, I gained invaluable insights into their innovative learning and feedback methods. Collaborating with [Štěpánka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%A1t%C4%9Bp%C3%A1nka-baierlov%C3%A1-7b2632237), [Anna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-puchovska), and [Luděk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lud%C4%9Bk-role%C4%8Dek-9065959/) was particularly inspiring, while witnessing the students' enthusiasm was truly rewarding.
