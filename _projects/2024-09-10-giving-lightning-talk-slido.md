At [Slido](https://www.slido.com/) offsites, it's tradition to present subjects that fascinate us.
Though I enjoy public speaking, I hesitated to participate until this year, when I knew my topic:
["Those Who Can, Do; Those Who Can’t, Teach"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/102q9YcA9-NbcMFPAymZiqbcYfqKHz8n_ivueR3iW-DA/edit).
Naturally, I flipped the phrase to emphasise the opposite – that "those who can, teach".
By sharing my story, I hoped to inspire some of my colleagues in the audience to do the same.
