Organised by [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/) and [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/), I was invited to join [Radka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/radka-meres-017025a5) and [Tomáš](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-tremko) & [Julia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-pisarova-4091a3323) to speak on any topic related to data modelling. Taking this quite literally, I opted for a [gambler’s approach](https://benn.substack.com/p/a-gamblers-guide-to-giving-talks) with a talk titled [“Let’s Face It: Your Data Models Are Broken”](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ruNQ2TiIw7e5h1loKtt0wIpE9SHTwVuEF8phW6CU3fQ/edit?usp=sharing), drawing loosely on positive data nihilism. The feedback was unexpectedly enthusiastic, so I might take it even further next time!
