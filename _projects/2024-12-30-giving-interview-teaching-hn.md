Through my connections to [Začni učit!](https://zacniucit.cz/), I was put in touch with
[Markéta Hronová](https://hn.cz/autori/marketa-hronova-18884530), who conducted
[an interview with me](https://archiv.hn.cz/c7-67526750-qsjc5-ee646ccf58303c7)
on my journey from working in IT to teaching IT. Every good article is accompanied
by decent pictures, so I was also visited by photographer [Tomáš Škoda](http://skoda-photo.com/)
right at the school. What a pleasure and privilege it was!
