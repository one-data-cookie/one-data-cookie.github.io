[Filip](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipkuncar) from [ShipMonk](https://www.shipmonk.com/) decided to organise and host
a meetup on a topic that doesn't get enough attention in the data world – metadata. He invited me to join 
his colleague [Michal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-volesini) and
[Tomáš](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasgatial) from [Similarweb](https://www.similarweb.com/) to deliver an intro talk, and
I ended up giving [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pmL4xqjc03jO78EgxnpzEZnoAmk2t05AADrY0UnCfO8/edit?usp=sharing),
titled "Forget the Reports, Metadata is Your Product".
