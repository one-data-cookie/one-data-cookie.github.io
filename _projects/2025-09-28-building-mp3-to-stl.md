Exploring generative geometry, I developed a Python script that maps audio waveforms from MP3 files
into polar coordinates to generate 3D-printable vase models.
The process and examples are shared on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1435084-custom-vase-from-mp3-audio),
with the full implementation open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/mp3-to-stl).
