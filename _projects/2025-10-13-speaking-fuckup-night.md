Following an invitation from [Začni učit!](https://www.zacniucit.cz/),
I participated in a fuck-up night event for teachers in Prague, hosted by
[Hana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuznha) & [Markéta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark%C3%A9ta-holi%C5%A1ov%C3%A1-a50bab6b/). 
In [my presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG1XxIw9W0/XUZuVPIEv1qAxWrnotwD9A/edit),
I reflected on the challenge of balancing approachability with professionalism in teacher-student
relationships – essential for fostering trust and respect while maintaining
a productive learning environment.
