This is my **digital garden** – place for putting links, drafts, ideas; in particular anything related to *data*.

Keep in mind that this is *not* a blog. As it is the case for most gardens, it's never finished, only loosely tended, and evolves with time.

To distinguish notes' maturity though, they are marked by *season*:
- `summer` – very solid and happy about it
- `spring` – in progress but with good content already
- `winter` – just started
- `autumn` – needs some rewriting (not visible)

Explore as you please below or just go to a [random note](/random).
