This is my **digital garden** – a place for putting links, drafts, and ideas;
in particular, anything related to *data*. 

It's a place that is
["both intimate and public, weird and welcoming"](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).
It's closely aligned with the concepts of the [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)
or [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) but not the same.

Most importantly, this is *not* a blog. As is the case for most gardens,
it's never finished, only loosely tended, and evolves with time.

To distinguish notes' maturity, they are marked by *season*:
- `summer` – very solid and happy with it
- `spring` – in progress but with good content already
- `winter` – just started
- `autumn` – needs some rewriting (not visible)

Explore as you please below or just go to a [random note](/random).
