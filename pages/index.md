# Hello there, I'm Michal!
🧠 I like to keep myself **[organised](/notes), [simply clever](https://www.skoda-auto.com/world/simply-clever), and [open](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/open-mindedness)**. And I'm keen on people, as well as [things and software](/uses) that manifest such qualities, too.

🎓 I love **learning and expanding my horizons**, be it [coding](https://github.com/one-data-cookie) or fields like mathematics, physics, sociology, political science, history, and especially education.

🌍 I'm currently based back in my home town of **[Brno, Czech Republic](https://youtu.be/fkCOXZmiKj8)** but I lived in London, UK for a few years and travelled around the globe (quite literally in 2019).

## In the digital world
📊 I'm an enthusiast into **anything data analytics**, in particular topics of [modern data stack](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/future-of-the-modern-data-stack), [data visualisation](/posts), and [data literacy](https://thedataliteracyproject.org/posts/how-do-you-define-data-literacy); all designed to empower individuals and organisations alike.

💜 Most of my days are spent [being purple](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/we-the-purple-people) as an **[analytics engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) lead at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/)**, making sure our colleagues have access to clean data and feel confident using it to make decisions.

🤗 I very much enjoy giving back to community by **sharing what I know** through [creating, organising, speaking, and teaching](/projects).

## Away from laptop
🌲 **Walking in nature** (alone, with my wife, or [our dog](https://www.instagram.com/falco.theminidachshund/); anywhere in the world)

📚 **Reading good stories** (mostly biographies; could be [almost any book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96238548-michal-kolacek) though)

🏸 **Playing racquet sports** ([squash](https://youtu.be/nTcvGK3k1IQ?t=55), [badminton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0-tt6BFY5Y), [table tennis](https://youtu.be/tR6BUanG96k?t=268); all will do)
