# Hello there, I'm Michal!
<br>

:blush: I like to keep myself [organised](https://onedatacookie-digigarden.netlify.app/), [simply clever](https://www.skoda-auto.com/world/simply-clever), and [open](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/open-mindedness). And I'm keen on people, things, and software that are the same. Oh, and I really enjoy hacking my life by automating and optimisating my workflow.

:mortar_board: I love learning and expanding my horizons, be it [coding](https://github.com/one-data-cookie) or fields like mathematics, physics, sociology, politics, and history.

:earth_africa: I'm now based back in my home city **[Brno, Czech Republic](https://youtu.be/hgU04LO60iU)** but I lived in London, UK for a few years and travelled around the globe (quite literally in 2019).

## In the digital world
:bar_chart: I'm an enthusiast into anything **data analytics**, in particular topics of [modern data stack](https://blog.getdbt.com/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/), [data visualisation](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization), and [data literacy](https://thedataliteracyproject.org/posts/how-do-you-define-data-literacy).

:purple_heart: Most of my day is spent [being purple](https://blog.getdbt.com/we-the-purple-people/) as an **[analytics engineer](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) at [Slido](https://slido.com/)**, making sure my colleagues have access to clean data and feel confident using it to make decisions.

:heart: If the time allows, I love **sharing what I know about data** through mentoring, teaching, and other [projects](/projects).

## Away from laptop
:evergreen_tree: **Walking in nature** (alone, with my spouse, or our dog; anywhere in the world)

:books: **Reading good stories** (preferably biographies or history of Czechoslovakia; fictional ones, too, though)

:tennis: **Playing raquet sports** (squash, badminton, table tennis, tennis; any will do)
