# Hello there, I'm Michal!
🧠 I like to keep myself [organised](/notes), [simply clever](https://www.skoda-auto.com/world/simply-clever), and [open](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/open-mindedness). And I'm keen on people, as well as [things and software](/uses) that manifest these qualities, too.

🎓 I love learning and expanding my horizons, be it [coding](https://github.com/one-data-cookie) or fields like mathematics, physics, sociology, politics, history, and education.

🌍 I'm currently based back in my hometown of **[Brno, Czech Republic](https://youtu.be/hgU04LO60iU)** but I lived in London, UK for a few years and travelled around the globe (quite literally in 2019).

## In the digital world
📊 I'm an enthusiast into anything **data analytics**, in particular topics of [modern data stack](https://blog.getdbt.com/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/), [data visualisation](/posts), and [data literacy](https://thedataliteracyproject.org/posts/how-do-you-define-data-literacy).

💜 Most of my day is spent [being purple](https://blog.getdbt.com/we-the-purple-people/) as a **head of [analytics engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/)**, making sure our colleagues have access to clean data and feel confident using it to make decisions.

🤗 If the time allows, I love **sharing what I know** through [creating, organising, speaking, and teaching](/projects).

## Away from laptop
🌲 **Walking in nature** (alone, with my wife, or [our dog](https://www.instagram.com/falco.theminidachshund/); anywhere in the world)

📚 **Reading good stories** (mostly biographies; fiction books, too, though)

🏸 **Playing racquet sports** (squash, badminton, table tennis; any will do)
