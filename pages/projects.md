## If Now
This autumn keeps me busy with organising, attending, or speaking at several local data meetups, so I cannot wait to see how these unfold!

Scroll down to check some of my previous engagements and projects.

## Else

### Speaking at datavis meetup vol. 8
In December 2022, I had a chance to speak at a [datavis meetup](https://datavismeetup.cz/) that I've been attending from its very beginning. With the aim to kick off a future line-up of talks from the business environment, I went for a general topic of [building a data team](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vZcHtejtTQ7_QGLndS1ShC5O3jNxkKjjv5abtNH77M4/edit?usp=sharing).

### Teaching data storytelling at Czechitas
In November 2022 (similar to [November 2021](https://youtu.be/YoCbP-f_fEc) and [May 2022](https://youtu.be/XbPFNBdAdW0)), I was invited by [Czechitas](https://www.czechitas.cz/en) to deliver a [lesson on data storytelling](https://youtu.be/m0n4mWlg6bE) (using [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17Zkeod1o1TYxVw-lFX49y0mSwqA7utFAatEMl4YsjIY/edit?usp=sharing)) for their Data Academy in Brno.

### Speaking at Coalesce 2022
In October 2022, I was honoured to have had the opportunity to travel to New Orleans, LA to speak again at [Colaesce](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/), the [analaytics engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) conference. This year, I joined my colleagues to [talk about Data API](https://youtu.be/SIZ4b0HJbUo) that we built at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/), as well as [Elizabeth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adlha) from [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) to [share some thoughts](https://youtu.be/VdiYC8LU4a0) about bringing a product mindset to the data analytics workflow.

### Speaking at Data Meetup in Prague
In June 2022, our data team at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/) joined forces with [Productboard](https://www.productboard.com/) to organise a data meetup in Prague on the topic of [analytics engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/). [My talk](https://youtu.be/x-NNLfh1jJA) focused on the practices we adopted and what impact they had on our everyday work. What a fun evening!

### Teaching IT at primary school with Zkus učit!
At the beginning of 2022, I got very excited by [changes to the way IT gets taught in the Czech Republic](https://revize.edu.cz/). As a result, I spent one week in May at a [primary school in Písek](https://www.zstylova.cz/eng/) teaching 12 and 15-year-old kids about IT using the priciples of [computational thinking](https://www.imysleni.cz/about-the-project). All thanks to an amazing educational project called [Začni učit!](https://zacniucit.cz/).

### Mentoring data projects at Czechitas
During spring 2022 (similar to autumns 2021 and 2020), I mentored pairs of emerging data analysts and supported them in their final projects for Brno Data Academy at [Czechitas](https://www.czechitas.cz/en). In 2022, [Katarína](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarina-hlavacova/) and [Hanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanna-de-lange-146a8b147/) [automated evaluation of Slovak districts in terms of their communication with local citizens](https://medium.com/@hanna.de.lange1991/odkaz-pre-starostu-automation-and-analysis-of-slovak-districts-evaluation-in-their-interaction-220b6058bfdc) whilst [Ivana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivana-benova/) and Kateřina [analysed tweets from Czech politicans about immigration](https://medium.com/@ivca.benova/anal%C3%BDza-tweet%C5%AF-poslanc%C5%AF-zam%C4%9B%C5%99en%C3%A1-na-t%C3%A9ma-uprchlictv%C3%AD-v-letech-2015-a-2022-d3306ab96b43). In 2021, [Renáta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renata-turonova/) and Daniela [had a look into the topic of cybercrime](https://public.tableau.com/views/DAPROJEKTJakbezpenojevkyberprostoru/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
In 2020, [Adéla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adela-procha/) and [Elena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-gorokhova/) chose to [explore Brno's participatory budget](https://public.tableau.com/views/PaRo-grafy1/NavigationDB?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

### Building michalkolacek.xyz
In early 2022, I created this very website. As a result, I learned a bit about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and reminded myself of some CSS and HTML. Thanks to that, I also significantly improved my [digital garden](/notes), as well as made automations to it through [Python and bash scripts](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/one-data-cookie.github.io/tree/main/utilities).

### Building modern data stack for all
At the end of December 2021, I was playing around with some tools of the [modern data stack](https://blog.getdbt.com/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/). I ended up building a minimalistic and free version of it called Modern Data Stack for All at[`one-data-cookie/mds4all-elt`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/mds4all-elt) and [`one-data-cookie/mds4all-superset`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/mds4all-superset) whilst utilising [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), [Meltano](https://meltano.com/), [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), and [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

### Speaking at Coalesce 2021
In December 2021, my colleagues from [Slido](https://www.slido.com/) and I had a chance to [talk](https://youtu.be/YA0yqYSs9BQ) at [Colaesce](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/), the [analaytics engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) conference. We shared our analytics story and I showed a demo of [`dbt-superset-lineage`](https://github.com/slidoapp/dbt-superset-lineage), open-source CLI app coded in Python that connects [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) and [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/).

### Teaching data literacy at Masaryk University
In Novemeber 2021, [Tomáš Marek](https://www.marektomas.cz/), [Jáchym Kubáček](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1chym-kub%C3%A1%C4%8Dek/), and myself put together a course on data literacy at the [Faculty of Arts of Masaryk University](https://www.phil.muni.cz/en). The initial audience consisted mostly of librarians, however, we also created an [online course](https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/kisk4future/datova-gramotnost) designed for and available to anyone.

### Standardising geo data at JIC
In October 2021, I helped out [JIC](https://www.jic.cz/en/), the Innovation Centre for South Moravian Region, with standardising their geo data from multiple sources. As a part of the process, I created [`geocode-mapycz`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/geocode-mapycz) that wraps JavaScript geocoding API of [Mapy.cz](https://en.mapy.cz/) in Python.

### Taking part in datavis community
At the beginning of 2021, I was at the inception of [datavis meetups](https://datavismeetup.cz/), hence I've been taking part and helping out a bit since. We tend to meet in Brno and talk about anything related to data visualisation in quite a casual environment; featuring speakers from NGOs, print media, public sector, universities, and businesses.
