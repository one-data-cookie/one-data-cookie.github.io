## If Now
My first weeks of 2023 are pretty chilled (even with some time off planned!) to recharge batteries for anything that's to come later this year.

Scroll down to check some of my previous engagements and projects.

## Else

### Leading a workshop on Superset for public sector
In February 2023, I was invited by [Petr Bouchal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petrbouchal) from [České priority](https://www.ceskepriority.cz/) to lead a workshop on [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), a visualisation tool we've been long using at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/). With representatives from [Technology Agency of the Czech Republic](https://www.tacr.cz/en/), [Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic](https://www.mpo.cz/en/), and [CzechInvest](https://www.czechinvest.org/en), it was a lively discussion that delved into the similarities and differences in our use cases between the private and public sectors.

### Speaking at Data Mesh meetup in Brno
As a follow-up on my podcast episode of [Data Talk](https://datatalk.buzzsprout.com/), [Jiří Vicherek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vicherek/) and [Karel Šimánek](linkedin.com/in/karelsimanek/) asked me to speak at their first-ever [Data Mesh meetup](https://www.datamesh.cz/) in Brno in mid-February 2023. I had a blast sharing my insights on the [power of using a product management mindset](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x99TqWWr4KA3AeW06Yg67yCek14_PtmZKsEi5c03bKY/edit?usp=sharing) to drive data product success at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/).

### Having a chat on the Data Talk podcast show
Already the first week of 2023 brought an exciting experience – appearing as a guest on a podcast episode of [Data Talk](https://datatalk.buzzsprout.com/). I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was thrilled about the idea. And it didn't disappoint! I ended up having an [inspiring conversation](https://datatalk.buzzsprout.com/2034779/12010833-data-talk-21-michal-kolacek-slido) with two other data enthusiasts – [Jiří Vicherek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vicherek/) and [Karel Šimánek](linkedin.com/in/karelsimanek/) – about the people, technology, and overarching philosophy behind our data story at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/).

### Winning the datavis challenge from Seznam
Just before Christmas time in [2021](https://blog.seznam.cz/2021/11/soutez-tableau-vyzva-od-analytiku-z-vyhledavani/) and [2022](https://blog.seznam.cz/2022/11/soutez-analytici-z-vyhledavani-vas-zvou-do-tableau-vyzvy/), the analytics team from [Seznam](https://www.seznam.cz/) invited the Czech data community to play around with a (tweaked) dataset on their search engine's traffic and prepare a visualisation in [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/). Not sure how but I ended up being brought to the spotlight on [both](https://blog.seznam.cz/2022/03/5-tipu-pro-vase-vizualizace-aneb-to-nejlepsi-z-tableau-vyzvy/) [occasions](https://blog.seznam.cz/2023/02/zname-viteze-2-rocniku-vyzvy-od-analytiku/).

### Organising dbt meetup in Brno
Having joined forces with [Michal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dubravcik) from [Kontent](https://kontent.ai/), we put together the very first [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) meetup in Brno. It took place at [Kentico](https://www.kentico.com/) HQ in mid-December and we strived for introducing this beloved data tool of ours to local audience through [these talks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XZS-x6uIiNbAKBOUHOGq-c8pg7Q-uYYh2FbHIMqeSus/edit?usp=sharing) delivered by Michal himself, [Ivo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-steiner) from [Slido](https://www.slido.com/), and [Pavel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jezekpavel) from [STRV](https://www.strv.com/). As I also had the pleasure to host the event (while having been able to throw in some Christmas spirit), I've found it to be great fun! And – based on the feedback (4.9/5) – I might not have been alone.

### Hosting data meetup in Bratislava
We at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/) long felt that there wasn't a decent platform for sharing inspiration and best practices amongst data practitioners in Bratislava. That's why we kicked off a series of data meetups together with our friends from [Kiwi](https://www.kiwi.com/). The first edition came about in early December and was focused on analytics. It featured [these talks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16lasZVOzDS87bCialZzpAa2Q9JS2zEbx8mEaH5euN9c/edit?usp=sharing) given by [Jakub] from [Assetario](https://www.assetario.com/), [Miriama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miriama-k%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%BEkov%C3%A1-998731114) from [Slido](https://www.slido.com/), and [Tomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-tremko) from [Kiwi](https://www.kiwi.com/). There is also a [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiY3TYQfLNU) available, so you can judge for yourself how it went and also whether my hosting fit the bill.

### Evaluating data projects at Czechitas
In December 2022, I was invited by [Czechitas](https://www.czechitas.cz/en) to sit on a jury with [Milada](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milada-sejnohova) and [Pavel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-klammert-9500046b) to evaluate [data projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bag3ntZsNyq9fi0AK2qWAF-6qQiTyrRr3dIO4FrkWJ8/edit?usp=sharing) of emerging data analysts who just finished the [Data Academy](https://www.czechitas.cz/kurzy/digitalni-akademie-data). And it was amazing to see it was (almost) all about using open data or making an analysis for a good cause!

### Speaking at datavis meetup vol. 8
In December 2022, I had a chance to speak at a [datavis meetup](https://datavismeetup.cz/) that I've been attending from its very beginning. With the aim to kick off a future line-up of talks from the business environment, I went for a general topic of [building a data team](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vZcHtejtTQ7_QGLndS1ShC5O3jNxkKjjv5abtNH77M4/edit?usp=sharing).

### Teaching data storytelling at Czechitas
In November 2022 (similar to [November 2021](https://youtu.be/YoCbP-f_fEc) and [May 2022](https://youtu.be/XbPFNBdAdW0)), I was invited by [Czechitas](https://www.czechitas.cz/en) to deliver a [lesson on data storytelling](https://youtu.be/m0n4mWlg6bE) (using [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17Zkeod1o1TYxVw-lFX49y0mSwqA7utFAatEMl4YsjIY/edit?usp=sharing)) for their Data Academy in Brno.

### Speaking at Coalesce 2022
In October 2022, I was honoured to have had the opportunity to travel to New Orleans, LA to speak again at [Colaesce](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/), the [analaytics engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) conference. This year, I joined my colleagues to [talk about Data API](https://youtu.be/SIZ4b0HJbUo) that we built at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/), as well as [Elizabeth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adlha) from [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) to [share some thoughts](https://youtu.be/VdiYC8LU4a0) about bringing a product mindset to the data analytics workflow.

### Speaking at Data Meetup in Prague
In June 2022, our data team at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/) joined forces with [Productboard](https://www.productboard.com/) to organise a data meetup in Prague on the topic of [analytics engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/). [My talk](https://youtu.be/x-NNLfh1jJA) focused on the practices we adopted and what impact they had on our everyday work. What a fun evening!

### Teaching IT at primary school with Zkus učit!
At the beginning of 2022, I got very excited by [changes to the way IT gets taught in the Czech Republic](https://revize.edu.cz/). As a result, I spent one week in May at a [primary school in Písek](https://www.zstylova.cz/eng/) teaching 12 and 15-year-old kids about IT using the priciples of [computational thinking](https://www.imysleni.cz/about-the-project). All thanks to an amazing educational project called [Začni učit!](https://zacniucit.cz/).

### Mentoring data projects at Czechitas
During spring 2022 (similar to autumns 2021 and 2020), I mentored pairs of emerging data analysts and supported them in their final projects for Brno's edition of [Data Academy](https://www.czechitas.cz/kurzy/digitalni-akademie-data) at [Czechitas](https://www.czechitas.cz/en). In 2022, [Katarína](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarina-hlavacova/) and [Hanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanna-de-lange-146a8b147/) [automated evaluation of Slovak districts in terms of their communication with local citizens](https://medium.com/@hanna.de.lange1991/odkaz-pre-starostu-automation-and-analysis-of-slovak-districts-evaluation-in-their-interaction-220b6058bfdc) whilst [Ivana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivana-benova/) and Kateřina [analysed tweets from Czech politicans about immigration](https://medium.com/@ivca.benova/anal%C3%BDza-tweet%C5%AF-poslanc%C5%AF-zam%C4%9B%C5%99en%C3%A1-na-t%C3%A9ma-uprchlictv%C3%AD-v-letech-2015-a-2022-d3306ab96b43). In 2021, [Renáta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renata-turonova/) and Daniela [had a look into the topic of cybercrime](https://public.tableau.com/views/DAPROJEKTJakbezpenojevkyberprostoru/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
In 2020, [Adéla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adela-procha/) and [Elena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-gorokhova/) chose to [explore Brno's participatory budget](https://public.tableau.com/views/PaRo-grafy1/NavigationDB?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

### Building michalkolacek.xyz
In early 2022, I created this very website. As a result, I learned a bit about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and reminded myself of some CSS and HTML. Thanks to that, I also significantly improved my [digital garden](/notes), as well as made automations to it through [Python and bash scripts](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/one-data-cookie.github.io/tree/main/utilities).

### Building modern data stack for all
At the end of December 2021, I was playing around with some tools of the [modern data stack](https://blog.getdbt.com/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/). I ended up building a minimalistic and free version of it called Modern Data Stack for All at[`one-data-cookie/mds4all-elt`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/mds4all-elt) and [`one-data-cookie/mds4all-superset`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/mds4all-superset) whilst utilising [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), [Meltano](https://meltano.com/), [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), and [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

### Speaking at Coalesce 2021
In December 2021, my colleagues from [Slido](https://www.slido.com/) and I had a chance to [talk](https://youtu.be/YA0yqYSs9BQ) at [Colaesce](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/), the [analaytics engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) conference. We shared our analytics story and I showed a demo of [`dbt-superset-lineage`](https://github.com/slidoapp/dbt-superset-lineage), open-source CLI app coded in Python that connects [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) and [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/).

### Teaching data literacy at Masaryk University
In Novemeber 2021, [Tomáš Marek](https://www.marektomas.cz/), [Jáchym Kubáček](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j%C3%A1chym-kub%C3%A1%C4%8Dek/), and myself put together a course on data literacy at the [Faculty of Arts of Masaryk University](https://www.phil.muni.cz/en). The initial audience consisted mostly of librarians, however, we also created an [online course](https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/kisk4future/datova-gramotnost) designed for and available to anyone.

### Standardising geo data at JIC
In October 2021, I was invited by [Milad Abassi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miladabassi) to help out [JIC](https://www.jic.cz/en/), the Innovation Centre for South Moravian Region, with standardising their geo data from multiple sources. As a part of the process, I created [`geocode-mapycz`](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/geocode-mapycz) that wraps JavaScript geocoding API of [Mapy.cz](https://en.mapy.cz/) in Python.

### Taking part in datavis community in Brno
At the beginning of 2021, I was at the inception of [datavis meetups](https://datavismeetup.cz/), hence I've been taking part and helping out a bit since. We meet in Brno and talk about anything related to data visualisation in quite a casual environment; featuring speakers from NGOs, print media, public sector, universities, and businesses.
