The full breadth of my interests, activities, and versions of self is quite extensively
written up on the [landing page](/). More details and occasional updates about my (professional)
life can be also found on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kolacekm/).

To keep with the tradition of [now pages](https://nownownow.com/) though,
**here is what I'm up to** these days:
- Leading the data team at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/)
- Teaching IT to children aged 13â€“15 at [TyrÅ¡ovka](https://www.tyrsovkakurim.cz/)
- Teaching a [data course](https://kisk.phil.muni.cz/kisked/kisked03) at Masaryk University
- Organising and participating in local (mostly data) meetups
- Mentoring a few data folks â€“ both juniors & seniors
