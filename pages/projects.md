This summer, I'm happy to be just chilling and enjoying the sun! 🌻

But in autumn 🍂, I expect to be:
- Teaching IT to children aged 13–15 at [Tyršovka](https://www.tyrsovkakurim.cz/), a public primary school in Kuřim near Brno
- Teaching an extensive, semester-long data course at [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/en)
- Organising and participating in (mostly) local data meetups
- Mentoring a few other data folks – both juniors & seniors

Check out some of my previous engagements and projects below!
