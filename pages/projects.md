This spring, I'm thrilled to be:
- Teaching IT to children aged 13–15 at [Tyršovka](https://www.tyrsovkakurim.cz/),
  a public primary school in Kuřim near Brno
- Teaching IT to children aged 12–16 at [Labyrinth](https://labyrinthschool.cz/en/),
  a private laboratory school in Brno
- Organising and participating in local (mostly data) meetups
- Mentoring a few other data folks – both juniors & seniors

Check out some of my previous engagements and projects below!
