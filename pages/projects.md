This autumn, I'm thrilled to be:
- Teaching IT to children aged 13–15 at [Tyršovka](https://www.tyrsovkakurim.cz/), a primary school in Kuřim near Brno
- Teaching an extensive, semester-long data course at [Masaryk University](https://www.muni.cz/en)
- Helping out with data & digital transformation at [JINAG](https://jinag.eu/en)
- Organising and participating in (mostly) data meetups
