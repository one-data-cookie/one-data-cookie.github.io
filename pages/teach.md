I've continuously shared about technology and data – be it [notes](/garden),
[code](https://github.com/one-data-cookie), or tons of other stuff scattered
around this digital home of mine. When I [speak](/projects/?category=speaking) or
[organise](/projects/?category=organising), it's usually on these topics too.

Yet, I’m also [**a teacher by profession**](/projects/?category=teaching). And it only feels fair
to expand the scope and start publishing more about education as well. As such, I've already
[shared my story](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/102q9YcA9-NbcMFPAymZiqbcYfqKHz8n_ivueR3iW-DA/edit)
with colleagues and friends at Slido, and later even with the general public in an
[interview for Hospodářské noviny](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WGt20WOwUNY2tz5wxXOkEO6FvQLEoNfl/view?usp=sharing).

I've also [open-sourced](https://gist.github.com/one-data-cookie/cf3ad5b633f838f519455327af16468d)
my [GPT for creating lesson plans](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-LVHsur4qW-teacheur) and I publicly collect
all my links about teaching IT in a place I've named [InvenTárium](/inventarium).

Naturally, I have plenty of thoughts and notes on this topic. But they're all in Czech!
To get around that, I decided to try something simple for now – let ChatGPT do the work
and summarise some of what I have in English.

Since it's a generated text, I won’t go as far as calling it my "teaching philosophy".
Still, it reflects my writing style and perspective on the craft quite well!

So, without further ado, here goes...

## Summary
Education is built on respect, genuine relationships, and reflective practice. Children
need an environment where they feel safe and inspired, while adult learners value
practical lessons linked to real-life goals. Good teaching involves setting clear
targets, reducing cognitive load, and allowing learners to choose how they learn.

Teachers themselves must also grow. They need to reflect, share ideas, and care for
their own well-being. Debates about 'freedom' in education show that many hope to
foster creativity and autonomy, though it is not always easy. Schools differ widely in
approach, so it is wise to find one that aligns with your values, marking policies,
and support structures.

Ultimately, good teaching is a journey that combines structure with freedom and
guidance with autonomy. When we add curiosity and mutual respect, we create a dynamic
space where everyone can thrive.

## Teaching Lessons
Lessons benefit from a structured approach:
- Set objectives using Bloom's taxonomy, targeting both knowledge and affective goals.
- Use the E-U-R cycle (Evocation, Understanding, Reflection) to frame activities.
- Offer digestible content, modelling tasks to reduce cognitive overload.
- Include retrieval practice or spaced repetition to reinforce understanding.

A well-planned lesson is still flexible. Adapt to students' responses, maintain a
backup option, and provide timely feedback. With clear intent and some agility, lessons
become both productive and engaging.

## Teaching Children
Working with children calls for empathy and respectful guidance:
- Let them experience a sense of safety, joy, and trust in the classroom.
- Offer choices wherever possible, helping them build responsibility and ownership.
- Communicate fairly and openly, use descriptive feedback, and avoid harsh punishment.
- Cultivate a democratic setting: let them discuss rules, reflect on behaviour, and
  practise self-assessment.

While challenges arise, staying calm and consistent helps. Seeking support from
colleagues or specialists can resolve difficult issues, allowing you to maintain a
warm, balanced atmosphere where children look forward to learning.

## Teaching Adults
Adults bring life experience and clear goals to the table:
- Emphasise relevance: show how each lesson benefits their personal or professional
  needs.
- Focus on practical methods: concise materials, microlearning, and real-life
  case studies work well.
- Provide autonomy by letting them tailor some aspects of their learning path.
- Keep it problem-centric: they often learn best by tackling scenarios drawn from
  everyday situations.

A supportive environment, with clear objectives and consistent feedback, keeps adults
motivated. Encourage them to apply new skills immediately and see real outcomes from
their efforts.

## Teaching Myself
Teachers need ongoing growth and self-care:
- Set realistic expectations: developing mastery takes time.
- Protect your well-being: prioritise tasks, set boundaries, and ask for help when
  needed.
- Reflect regularly: note successes and missteps, possibly record lessons or share with
  a mentor.
- Connect with others: form a community, swap insights, and keep curiosity alive.

By embracing a reflective mindset, you refine your teaching craft, stay energised, and
better serve your learners.

## Teaching Differently
Innovation keeps learning fresh and meaningful:
- Change the physical space or try tandem teaching to break routine.
- Encourage student-led projects or real-world tasks, such as managing finances or
  designing 3D objects.
- Stress immediate enjoyment, not just future utility, to keep motivation high.
- Offer gradual independence, letting older students help set objectives and plan
  lessons.

Being open to experimentation makes the classroom lively. Even small tweaks in your
approach can spark deeper engagement and highlight new strengths.

## Teaching with Freedom
Some question the rigidity of traditional education:
- Scholars like Holt and Robinson advocate for child-directed exploration, cautioning
  that strict models can suppress creativity.
- Balance is essential: give children choices suited to their maturity.
- Critics argue such freedom is naive, but moderate autonomy fosters ownership and
  responsibility.
- Change is often slow: it requires leadership support, flexible structures, and a
  willingness to test new models.

Offering more freedom within a structured framework can unlock potential and nurture
genuine enthusiasm for learning.

## Teaching in a School
Each school operates differently, so do your homework:
- Ask about marking policies, parental communication, induction steps, and collaborative
  teaching options.
- Check available resources, from technology to creative workspaces.
- Clarify day-to-day logistics, such as schedules, supervision, or behaviour guidelines.
- Look for mentors or parallel teachers who can align on objectives and share practical
  tips.

Solid relationships with colleagues, parents, and leadership are key. By finding a
school whose ethos matches your own, you create a supportive, thriving environment
for everyone.
